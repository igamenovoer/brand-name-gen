## HEADER
- **Purpose**: Stop tracking local `.env` and ignore going forward
- **Status**: Completed (pending repo commit)
- **Date**: 2025-10-04
- **Dependencies**: Git index state
- **Target**: Repository hygiene / secrets handling

## Summary
- `.env` is already listed in `.gitignore` for future ignores.
- The file is currently tracked in Git; removing from history is not required per request.
- Next action is to untrack it via `git rm --cached .env` and commit.

## Commands (to run locally)
```
git rm --cached .env
git commit -m "chore(security): stop tracking .env"
```

## Verification
- `git ls-files --error-unmatch .env` should return non-zero (not tracked).
- `git status` should show `.env` as untracked after the commit.

## Notes
- Keep using `env.example` as the template for local `.env`.
- No history rewrite performed, as keys are invalidated.
