# Tasks

## HEADER
- **Purpose**: Track current and planned work items (features, fixes, refactors, tests)
- **Status**: Active
- **Date**: 2025-10-04
- **Dependencies**: Plans, design docs
- **Target**: AI assistants and developers

## Content
Organize tasks by type inside subdirectories: `features/`, `fixes/`, `refactor/`, and `tests/`.
Each task file should include clear scope, acceptance criteria, and links to related docs.

Naming patterns:
- `features/task-implement-user-authentication.md`
- `fixes/task-fix-memory-leak.md`
- `refactor/task-modernize-api-endpoints.md`
- `tests/task-add-integration-tests.md`
- Optionally include a `goal.md` for a subfolderâ€™s main objective.
